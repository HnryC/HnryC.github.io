<ul>
<li>
Good conductors of heat and electricity

<li>
Lustrous: Shiny when freshly cut/polished

<li>
Malleable: Can be bent/squashed into different shapes

<li>
Ductile: Can be stretched into thin wires

<div id="What are alloys?"><h1 id="What are alloys?" class="header"><a href="#What are alloys?">What are alloys?</a></h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
Alloys are a combination of a pure metal with small amounts of other elements

<li>
These additives improve certain aspects of the metal and makes it better for human consumption

<li>
Examples of this include:

<ul>
<li>
Carbon added to iron to create steel

<li>
Chromium and nickel added to steel to create stainless steel

<li>
Lead additives to tin to lower the melting point in soft solder

</ul>
