\title{Vectors in 3 dimensions}

\begin{document}
Vectors are used to represent the relationship between points in space. They can be represented in Cartesian or polar form, where the Cartesian form represents the transformation along the standard basis vectors and the polar form is represented with a magnitude and rotation from the positive z direction.
